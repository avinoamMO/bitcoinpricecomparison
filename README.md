This project was built in order to help those who are interested in buying or selling Bitcoin, compare the return they would receive from different service providers in Israel.

The application receives the order book data, fees data and the rate prices from various service providers and calculates the expected return a client would receive in real-time, if he was to sell or buy the entire amount in a market order on the exchange or via a broker. 

The data is projected on easy-to-understand graphs and verbal explanations on the discrepencies between the existing services.

I will review the stack and logic of the application in a later time, at the moment it's in pre-mvp stage. :)
